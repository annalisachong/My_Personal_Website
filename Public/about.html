 <h1>About me</h1>
 Hi there! My name is Annalisa and I am a data analyst turned data scientist turned bioinformatician. 
 I am curious about many things in life and I find satisfaction in solving problems, which explains my career path for the past many years. 
 
 During my free time, I like to read, play mobile games and spend time with my family and friends. 
 I'm also into self improvement into the different areas of my life which led me to creating this website, where I hope to document down the bits and pieces of me online. 
 You can find out more about me through the different links below!
